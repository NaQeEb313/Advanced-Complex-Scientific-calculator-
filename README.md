# Calculator Project

This project includes multiple versions of a calculator, featuring basic operations, scientific functions, and complex number operations.

## Versions

### `/basic_calculator/` — Original Version:
The original version contains two calculators:

1. **Basic Calculator**:  
   - Simple operations:
     - Addition
     - Subtraction
     - Multiplication
     - Division

2. **Scientific Calculator**:  
   Includes all standard scientific functions:
   - Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
   - Logarithmic functions (ln, log)
   - Power operations

### `/v2_advanced_calculator/` — Updated Version:
This updated version adds more features:
- **Complex Number Support**:
  - Operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and conjugates for complex numbers.
  
- **Inverse Trigonometric Functions**:
  - Functions like arctan, arcsin, and arccos.
  
- Improved handling for error cases in scientific functions and more flexibility for calculations.

## Future Updates

In upcoming versions, the following features will be added:

- **Matrix Operations**:
  - Operations like matrix multiplication, determinant calculation, and inverse of a matrix.
  
- **Coordinate Geometry**:
  - Functions related to the geometry of points, lines, and shapes in 2D and 3D.
  - Calculations such as distance between points, area of triangles, and line intersections.

Stay tuned for more updates as the project evolves!
